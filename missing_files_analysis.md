## Action Plan for Recreation

### Documentation to Create
1. Create comprehensive system overview document
2. Complete database schema design documentation
3. Create detailed system architecture documentation with diagrams
4. Develop implementation timeline for remaining modules
5. Document potential challenges and solutions
6. Compile all documentation into a final comprehensive package

### Code to Recreate or Complete
1. Ensure all database migration scripts are complete and functional
2. Create templates for accounting module frontend components
3. Develop framework for AI-powered cash flow prediction
4. Complete integration tests for all existing modules

### Configuration to Create
1. Complete deployment configuration for production
2. Create environment configuration templates

This analysis will guide the recreation of necessary files and components in the next step of the handoff process.
