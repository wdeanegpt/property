   - Communication automation with PHA

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js (web) + React Native (mobile)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for RESTful API
- **Database**: 
  - PostgreSQL (structured data)
  - MongoDB (unstructured data)
  - Redis (caching)
- **AI/ML**: Python with TensorFlow and Flask microservice
- **Cloud**: AWS for hosting and infrastructure
- **Authentication**: JWT for secure sessions
- **Integrations**: Stripe, Plaid, Google Maps, Zapier

## Implementation Timeline
The immediate next steps for the project are:

1. **Deploy the Advanced Accounting Module**:
   - Follow the deployment instructions to deploy the module to production
   - Run database migrations to create the necessary tables
   - Verify all features are working correctly

2. **Prepare for Enhanced Tenant Management System**:
   - Review requirements for the Enhanced Tenant Management System
   - Plan implementation approach and resource allocation
   - Set up development environment for the next phase

3. **Develop AI-Powered Pre-Inspection Prototype**:
   - Build a prototype for AI-powered pre-inspections for Section 8 and general rentals
   - Focus on computer vision for detecting HQS violations
   - Create a user-friendly interface for uploading media and viewing reports

## Challenges and Considerations
- HUD/PHA API availability is unconfirmedâ€”may require email automation as a fallback
- Integration with 3,300+ Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) across the US
- Ensuring compliance with HUD standards and regulations
- Balancing features across different user types (tenants, landlords, property managers)
