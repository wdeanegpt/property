   - ExpenseManagementService
   - Integration module for cross-service functionality

2. **API Endpoints**
   - Complete RESTful API for all accounting functions
   - Authentication and authorization integration
   - Input validation and error handling

3. **Database Schema**
   - Migration files for all required tables
   - Migration runner utility for automated deployment

4. **Frontend Components**
   - RentTrackingDashboard
   - Navigation integration
   - Routing configuration

5. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for all services
