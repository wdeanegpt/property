## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
Five database migration files have been created to support the Advanced Accounting Module:
1. `001_create_recurring_payments_table.sql` - For tracking rent and other recurring payments
2. `002_create_late_fee_configurations_table.sql` - For configuring late fee rules
3. `003_create_late_fees_table.sql` - For tracking applied late fees
4. `004_create_trust_account_transactions_table.sql` - For managing trust fund transactions
5. `005_create_receipt_images_table.sql` - For expense receipt management

### Service Architecture
- All services follow a consistent architecture with proper error handling
- Services are fully documented with JSDoc comments
- Each service is designed to be modular and reusable
- Services interact with the PostgreSQL database using the node-postgres library

### Frontend Implementation
- Built with React and Material-UI for a modern, responsive interface
- Implements component-based architecture for maintainability
- Features interactive data tables, modal dialogs, and notification systems
- Integrates with backend services through API calls
