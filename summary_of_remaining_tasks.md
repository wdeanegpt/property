# Comprehensive Property Management System - Summary of Remaining Tasks

## Project Overview

The Comprehensive Property Management System is a full-featured property management platform with AI-enhanced capabilities, serving tenants, landlords, property managers, and housing authorities across all 50 U.S. states. The system evolved from an affordable housing application focused on HUD programs into a comprehensive platform with eight core modules:

1. **Tenant Management**: Handles tenant applications, screening, lease management, communication, and tenant portal access.
2. **Property Management**: Manages property listings, unit details, amenities, and compliance with housing regulations.
3. **Financial Management**: Tracks rent collection, expenses, accounting, and financial reporting.
4. **Maintenance Management**: Coordinates maintenance requests, work orders, vendor management, and preventive maintenance.
5. **Communication Hub**: Facilitates communication between tenants, landlords, property managers, and housing authorities.
6. **Reporting and Analytics**: Provides insights into property performance, tenant behavior, and financial health.
7. **Pricing and Accessibility**: Implements tiered subscription plans with feature-based access control.
8. **Integration and API**: Connects with external services and provides API access for custom integrations.

## Current Status

- **Web Application**: Deployed at https://xgfxgabn.manus.space/
- **Current Step**: 022 - Preparing handoff for next implementation steps
- **Next Step**: 023 - Completing and reorganizing advanced accounting module
- **Previous Milestone**: Successfully implemented pricing and accessibility module with tiered subscription plans

## Completed Work

Based on the previous session and handoff documentation, the following components have been designed and documented:

1. **Tenant Interface**: Complete design with component hierarchy, core features, API services, database schema updates, and testing strategy.
2. **Property Management Interface**: Complete design with component hierarchy, core features, API services, database schema updates, and testing strategy.
3. **Communication Hub**: Complete design with messaging center, notification system, announcement board, document sharing, and communication settings.
4. **Reporting and Analytics**: Complete design for reporting and analytics framework.
5. **Integration Framework**: Complete design for integration with external services.
6. **AI Enhancement Layer**: Complete design with form filling automation, tenant screening, maintenance issue classification, property valuation algorithms, and chatbot support system.
7. **System Integration**: Architecture connecting all components, establishing data flows, API patterns, authentication/authorization, and deployment configurations.

Additionally, the following work has been completed:

- **Database Schema Expansion**: Expanded PostgreSQL schema to support all eight core modules, implemented MongoDB collections for unstructured data and AI functionality, and set up Redis caching structures.
- **Pricing and Accessibility Module**: Implemented Free Tier (up to 5 units), Standard Tier ($2/unit/month), and Enterprise Tier (custom pricing), along with AI-driven pricing recommendations.
- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed city selection functionality on tenant onboarding location page.
