## Recommendations

While the system is functioning as expected, the following recommendations are made for future development:

1. **Enhanced Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure the application is fully optimized for all mobile devices
2. **Expanded User Testing**: Conduct additional user testing with actual tenants, landlords, and housing authorities
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive performance monitoring before scaling to more users
4. **Accessibility Compliance**: Verify full compliance with WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines
5. **Documentation Updates**: Maintain living documentation that evolves with the system

These recommendations are not critical issues but would enhance the system's usability, performance, and maintainability as it scales.
