# Component Development Priorities

This document outlines the prioritization of components for the Comprehensive Property Management System, along with their dependencies and implementation order.

## Priority Order

1. **Tenant Interface**
   - Foundation for user interaction
   - Critical for tenant engagement and satisfaction
   - Prerequisite for many other components

2. **Property Management Interface**
   - Core functionality for property managers and landlords
   - Builds on tenant data structures
   - Essential for day-to-day operations

3. **Communication Hub**
   - Connects all stakeholders
   - Enhances both tenant and property management interfaces
   - Enables efficient information flow

4. **Reporting and Analytics**
   - Builds on data from other components
   - Provides insights for decision-making
   - Enhances value of existing features

5. **Integration Framework**
   - Connects with external systems
   - Extends functionality through third-party services
   - Enables ecosystem growth

6. **AI Enhancement Layer**
   - Adds intelligence to existing features
   - Improves user experience across all components
   - Provides competitive advantage

## Component Dependencies

```
Tenant Interface <---- Property Management Interface <---- Communication Hub
       ^                          ^                               ^
       |                          |                               |
       v                          v                               v
Reporting & Analytics <------ Integration Framework <------ AI Enhancement Layer
```

## Implementation Strategy

For each component, we will:
1. Design the architecture
2. Implement core functionality
3. Create tests
4. Document the implementation
5. Update the handoff document

## Handoff Document Updates

After completing each component, we will update the handoff document with:
1. Component architecture diagram
2. Implementation details
3. Code snippets and file locations
4. Testing procedures
5. Integration points with other components

This ensures continuity if development needs to be resumed in a future session.
