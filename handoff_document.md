# Property Management System - Handoff Document

## Project Overview

The Property Management System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to help property managers and landlords efficiently manage their properties across all 50 U.S. states. The system includes AI-enhanced capabilities for automation and prediction, serving various stakeholders including property managers, landlords, tenants, and regulatory agencies.

This handoff document provides essential information for developers, administrators, and stakeholders who will be working with the system.

## System Architecture

The Property Management System follows a modern client-server architecture:

### Frontend
- **Technology**: React.js with Material UI
- **Structure**: Component-based architecture with modular dashboards
- **State Management**: Context API and hooks for state management
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts library for charts and graphs

### Backend
- **Technology**: Node.js with Express.js
- **API Design**: RESTful API with versioning
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data storage
- **ORM**: Knex.js for database queries and migrations

### AI Components
- **Prediction Models**: TensorFlow.js for cash flow prediction
- **Error Detection**: Custom anomaly detection algorithms
- **Data Processing**: Python scripts for data preprocessing

## Core Modules

The system is organized into eight core modules:

1. **Property Management**: For managing property details, units, and amenities
2. **Tenant Management**: For managing tenant information, leases, and communications
3. **Maintenance Management**: For tracking maintenance requests and scheduling repairs
4. **Document Management**: For storing and managing legal documents and forms
5. **Accounting**: For tracking rent, expenses, and financial reporting
6. **Compliance**: For ensuring regulatory compliance across different jurisdictions
7. **Reporting**: For generating customized reports and analytics
8. **Administration**: For system settings, user management, and access control

This handoff document focuses primarily on the Accounting Module, which includes:
- Rent tracking with automated late fees
- Trust accounting with separate ledgers
- Expense management with receipt scanning
- Financial reporting and tax preparation
- AI-powered cash flow prediction and error detection

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Mobile Application**: The mobile application is not yet implemented and is planned for future development.
2. **Document Management Integration**: The document management module has limited integration with the accounting module.
3. **Multi-currency Support**: The system currently supports USD only; multi-currency support is planned for future releases.
4. **Batch Processing**: Bulk operations for payments and expenses are limited in the current version.
5. **Reporting Customization**: Report customization options are limited in the current version.

### Known Issues

1. **Trust Account Reconciliation**: The trust account reconciliation process may show discrepancies when transactions are processed near midnight due to timezone handling.
2. **Receipt Image Processing**: Very large receipt images (>10MB) may cause timeout issues during upload.
3. **Cash Flow Prediction Accuracy**: The prediction model may have reduced accuracy for properties with less than 6 months of historical data.
4. **Late Fee Calculation**: Edge cases in late fee calculation may occur when payment due dates fall on weekends or holidays.
5. **Financial Report Generation**: Generating reports with very large datasets (>10,000 transactions) may cause performance issues.
